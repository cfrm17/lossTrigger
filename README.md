# lossTrigger
There are a series of time varying loss triggers built in the trade. If at any time before the trade maturity the accumulated loss amount of the entire collateral pool reaches a predefined level, the trade terminates and is settled on the mark-to-market (MTM) of the underlying super senior tranche or the funded amount, whichever is less.
